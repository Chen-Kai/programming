### Object
A object:
* Holds data
* Does somthing.

### Class
A class defines two things for an object of this class:
* The **data** it holds. 
* The **message** it can receive. 

##### The lifetime of variables.
* The variables in a method are alive until the method returns.
* object fields are alive until the object points to null.
* static variables are alive as long as the program is running. 

##### Array in Java (Repost from "Thinking in Java")
> When you create an array of objects, you are really creating an array of references, and each of those references is automatically initialized to `null`. You must assign an object to each reference before you use it, and if you try to use a reference that is still `null`, the problem will be reported at run time.   
> When you create an array of primitives, the compiler guarantees initialization because it zeroes the memory for that array.

##### Garbage collector
> GC looks at all the objects that were created with **new** and figures out which ones are not being referenced anymore. Then it releases that memory for those objects, so the memory can be used for new object.
